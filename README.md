# pyenv3
 This script creates a virtual environment named 'venv' using Python 3, activates it, and then upgrades the Pip package manager to its latest version. This is often used for managing dependencies of a specific project without affecting the global Python environment.
Install:
git clone https://github.com/ai640stu/pyenv3
cd ~/pyenv3
Run:
bash pyenv3.sh
